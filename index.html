<h1 style-"text-align:center">Pain's Purpose</h1>
<h2 style-"text-align:center">By Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h2>
<p style-"text-align:center">"How blind is he who prays that God will send all pain from Earth.<br/>
Pain has its use and place; its ministry of holiness and grace.<br/>
The darker tones upon the canvas blend<br/>
With light and colour; and their shadows lend the painting half its dignity.<br/>
Efface the sombre background, and you lose all trace<br/>
Of that perfection which is true art's trend."</p>

<p style-"text-align:center">Life is an artist seeking to reveal<br/>
God's majesty and beauty in each soul.<br/>
If from the palette mortal man could steal<br/>
The precious pigment, pain, why then scroll<br/>
Would glare with colours meaningless and bright,<br/>
Or show an empty canvas, blurred with light."</p>
